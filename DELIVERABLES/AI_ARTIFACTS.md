> **Goal**: Show your IDE and walk through one complex prompt/refinement from:
> - Include the actual prompts you used for each phase of your development process (planning, architecture, implementation, testing, etc.)
> - Show the progression from initial problem understanding to final implementation
> - Include at least one example where AI output required significant fixing and your follow-up prompts
> - Note which IDE/tool you used (Cursor, Claude Code, Copilot, etc.)
