MASTER SERVICE AGREEMENT

This Master Service Agreement (the “Agreement” or “MSA”) is entered into
this \_\_\_ day of October, 2025 (the “Effective Date”), by and between
**Very Big Things, LLC**, a Florida limited liability company, having
its principal place of business at 837 Northeast 2<sup>nd</sup> Avenue,
Fort Lauderdale, FL 33304 (“VBT”),
a\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ (the “Client” or “Shade Store”),
in order to clearly define the design, development and implementation of
the service(s) or product(s) to be provided by VBT, as well as the
ongoing terms of this agreement.

**1. PERFORMANCE OF SERVICES.** VBT will provide the Client with ongoing
consulting and development services and related deliverables (the
“Services”) as more fully described in the statement(s) of work (the
“SOW”) attached hereto as exhibits. Each SOW when executed by both the
Client and VBT shall form a part of this MSA and be subject to the terms
and conditions set forth herein. Services performed under a particular
SOW along with any associated deliverables, including but not limited to
UX/UI designs, drawings, documentation, software code, etc., shall
constitute a “Project.” During the Term (as defined below), Client will
have the right to request from VBT changes in the scope of Services set
forth in any SOW. Such request shall be made in writing (including via
email) and shall be submitted to the relevant VBT product owner for such
SOW. VBT will, within five (5) business days after receipt of such
request, inform Client in writing (including via email) of the impact,
if any, of the proposed change on the delivery schedule, fees and
Services. Following any negotiation by the parties, the parties will
prepare a final change order (each a “Change Order”) setting forth in
detail the changes to be implemented, the additional fees associated
therewith (if any), and the impact, if any, to any applicable delivery
schedule. Changes that are immaterial shall not be subject to an
additional fee or need for a Change Order. Upon execution of a Change
Order by an authorized representative of both of the parties, this
Agreement and the applicable SOW will be deemed amended thereby and
shall be added to this Agreement as an exhibit.

**2. CLIENT COOPERATION.** Client acknowledges and agrees that the
timely provision of assistance, cooperation, and complete and accurate
information and data from Client’s officers, agents and employees is
essential to VBT’s performance of the Services. Client’s obligations
under this paragraph 2 shall include:

- Setting the overall Project goals to better enable VBT to suggest and
  > recommend the Services to be performed, including making choices on
  > priorities and direction;

- Providing the necessary Client personnel and management involvement,
  > including reasonable attendance at meetings and workshops, to
  > support the Services and allow for decisions to be made on a timely
  > basis without undue delay; and

- Providing timely access to complete and accurate data sets required
  > for AI analysis as is necessary for the performance of the Services.

VBT shall not be liable for any deficiency in performing the Services to
the extent that such deficiency results from Client’s failure to meet
the above obligations in a commercially reasonable manner. VBT shall
inform Client in a timely manner of any failure of these obligations it
becomes aware of such deficiency.

**3. PERSONNEL.** VBT shall provide experienced and qualified personnel
to provide the Services and ensure performance under this MSA. VBT shall
ensure that in their performance under this MSA, its personnel and
subcontractors comply with Client’s reasonable standards, requests,
rules, and policies regarding the handling of data, workplace access,
professional conduct, and use of Client’s facilities and property. VBT
shall not subcontract the provision of any Services unless each such
subcontractor is bound by terms and conditions relating to
confidentiality, security, proprietary and intellectual property no less
restrictive than those provisions set forth in this MSA and VBT remains
liable for any action or inaction of such subcontractor. Subject to the
foregoing, VBT reserves the exclusive right to make all decisions
regarding which VBT personnel are staffed on providing Services as well
as to allow the assignment of subcontractors to ensure that the terms of
this Agreement and the Services are met as well as on-time completion.
However, Client in its discretion may request removal of any VBT
personnel or subcontractors who are providing Services under this
Agreement. If such request is made VBT and Client will work together to
reach a mutually agreeable solution to honor such request and minimize
any impact on the Services.

**4. PAYMENT TERMS.**

> **4.1** Client shall pay VBT pursuant to the terms of any SOW. Unless
> otherwise set forth in a SOW, Client will pay VBT all valid and
> undisputed amounts within thirty (30) days after receipt of VBT’s
> invoice. VBT shall submit invoices in reasonable detail to Client,
> including a description of the Services performed. VBT may suspend
> Services and/or terminate this Agreement and/or any SOW if, after
> receiving a written reminder from VBT, Client’s account remains past
> due for thirty (30) days from such written reminder.

**5. COPYRIGHT AND TRADEMARKS.** Each party unconditionally guarantees
that any elements of text, graphics, photos, designs, trademarks, or
other artwork furnished by such party for inclusion in any Project are
owned by such party, or alternatively, that such party has permission
from the rightful owner to use each of these elements solely in

from any third-party Losses (as defined below) (including attorney’s
fees and court costs), including any claim or suit, threatened or
actual, arising from the use of such elements per the instructions of
the furnishing party.
