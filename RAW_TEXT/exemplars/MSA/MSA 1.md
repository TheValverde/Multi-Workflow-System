MASTER SERVICE AGREEMENT

This Master Service Agreement (the “Agreement” or “MSA”) is entered into
this \_\_\_ day of September, 2025 (“Effective Date”), by and between
**Very Big Things, LLC**, a Florida limited liability company, having
its principal place of business at 837 Northeast 2<sup>nd</sup> Avenue,
Fort Lauderdale, FL 33304 (“VBT”), and **\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_**
(the “Client”), in order to clearly define the design, development and
implementation of the service(s) or product(s) to be provided by VBT, as
well as the ongoing terms of this agreement.

**1. PERFORMANCE OF SERVICES.** VBT will provide the Client with ongoing
consulting and development services as more fully described in one or
more statement(s) of work (the “SOW”), the initially accepted SOWs are
attached hereto as Exhibits A and B (collectively, the “Services”). Each
SOW when executed by both the Client and VBT shall form a part of this
MSA and be subject to the terms and conditions set forth herein.
Services performed under a particular SOW along with any associated
deliverables, including but not limited to UX/UI designs, drawings,
documentation, software code, etc., shall constitute a “Project.” Any
modification or addition to the Services desired by the Client must be
agreed to in writing by both parties and reduced to a SOW and
incorporated into this Agreement.

**2. CLIENT COOPERATION.** Client acknowledges and agrees that the
timely provision of assistance, cooperation, and complete and accurate
information and data from Client’s officers, agents and employees is
essential to VBT’s performance of the Services. Client’s obligations
under this paragraph 2 shall include:

- Setting the overall direction on the Services to be performed,
  > including making choices on priorities and direction;

- Providing the necessary Client personnel and management involvement,
  > including attendance at meetings and workshops, to support the
  > Services and allow for decisions to be made on a timely basis
  > without undue delay; and

- Providing timely access to complete and accurate data sets required
  > for AI analysis as is necessary for the performance of the Services.

VBT shall not be liable for any deficiency in performing the Services if
such deficiency results from Client’s failure to meet the above
obligations in a commercially reasonable manner. VBT shall inform Client
in a timely manner of any failure of these obligations it becomes aware
of.

**3. PERSONNEL.** VBT reserves the exclusive right to make all decisions
regarding which VBT personnel are staffed on providing Services as well
as to allow the assignment of subcontractors to ensure that the terms of
this Agreement and the Services are met as well as on-time completion.
However, Client in its discretion may request removal of any VBT
personnel or subcontractors who are providing Services under this
Agreement. If such a request is made VBT and Client will work together
to reach a mutually agreeable solution to honor such request and
minimize any impact on the Services.

**4. PAYMENT TERMS.**

> **4.1** Client shall pay VBT pursuant to the terms of any SOW. Any
> amounts not paid by the due date stated in the SOW shall be subject to
> an additional finance charge of 1.5% monthly. VBT reserves the right

> to collect any amount past due and Client shall pay all reasonable
> attorney’s fees or collections agency fees. VBT may suspend Services
> and/or terminate this Agreement and/or any SOW if Client’s account is
> more than fifteen (15) days past due.

> cover and include all sales and use taxes, duties, and charges of any
> kind imposed by any federal, state, or local governmental authority on

> Client be required to pay any additional amount to VBT in connection
> with such taxes, duties, and charges, or any taxes imposed on, or
> regarding, VBT's income, revenues, gross receipts, personnel, or real
> or personal property or other assets.</span>

from the rightful owner to use each of these elements, and will hold
harmless, protect, indemnify and defend the non-furnishing party and its
subcontractors from any liability (including attorney’s fees and court
costs), including any claim or suit, threatened or actual, arising from
the use of such elements.
