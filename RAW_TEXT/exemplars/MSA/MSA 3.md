MASTER SERVICE AGREEMENT

This Master Service Agreement (the “Agreement” or “MSA”) is entered into
this \_\_\_ day of October, 2025, by and between **Very Big Things,
LLC**, a Florida limited liability company, (“VBT”), and
**\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_**, (the “Client”), in order to
clearly define the design, development and implementation of the
service(s) or product(s) to be provided by VBT, as well as the ongoing
terms of this agreement.

**1. PERFORMANCE OF SERVICES.** VBT will provide the Client with ongoing
consulting and development services as more fully described in the
statement(s) of work (the “SOW”) attached hereto as exhibits (the
“Services”). Each SOW when executed by both the Client and VBT shall
form a part of this MSA and be subject to the terms and conditions set
forth herein. Services performed under a particular SOW along with any
associated deliverables, including but not limited to UX/UI designs,
drawings, documentation, software code, etc., shall constitute a
“Project.” Any modification or addition to the Services desired by the
Client must be agreed to in writing by both parties and reduced to a SOW
which shall be added to this Agreement as an exhibit.

**2. CLIENT COOPERATION.** Client acknowledges and agrees that the
timely provision of assistance, cooperation, and complete and accurate
information and data from Client’s officers, agents and employees is
essential to VBT’s performance of the Services. Client’s obligations
under this paragraph 2 shall include:

- Setting the overall direction on the Services to be performed,
  > including making choices on priorities and direction;

- Providing the necessary Client personnel and management involvement,
  > including attendance at meetings and workshops, to support the
  > Services and allow for decisions to be made on a timely basis
  > without undue delay; and

- Providing timely access to complete and accurate data sets required
  > for AI analysis as is necessary for the performance of the Services.

VBT shall not be liable for any deficiency in performing the Services if
such deficiency results from Client’s failure to meet the above
obligations in a commercially reasonable manner. VBT shall inform Client
in a timely manner of any failure of these obligations it becomes aware
of.

**3. PERSONNEL.** VBT reserves the exclusive right to make all decisions
regarding which VBT personnel are staffed on providing Services as well
as to allow the assignment of subcontractors to ensure that the terms of
this Agreement and the Services are met as well as on-time completion.
However, Client in its discretion may request removal of any VBT
personnel or subcontractors who are providing Services under this
Agreement. If such request is made VBT and Client will work together to
reach a mutually agreeable solution to honor such request and minimize
any impact on the Services.

**4. PAYMENT TERMS.**

> **4.1** Client shall pay VBT pursuant to the terms of any SOW. Any
> amounts not paid by the due date stated in the SOW shall be subject to
> an additional finance charge of 1.5% monthly. VBT reserves the right
> to use any and all means of collection available under applicable law
> to collect any amount past due and Client shall pay all reasonable
> attorney’s fees or collections agency fees. VBT may suspend Services
> and/or terminate this Agreement and/or any SOW if Client’s account is
> more than fifteen (15) days past due.
>
> **4.2** VBT reserves the right to adjust rates and fees for Services
> annually, effective on the anniversary date of this Agreement or upon
> thirty (30) days' written notice to Client. Client should anticipate

**5. COPYRIGHT AND TRADEMARKS.** Each party unconditionally guarantees
that any elements of text, graphics, photos, designs, trademarks, or
other artwork furnished by such party for inclusion in any Project are
owned by such party, or alternatively, that such party has permission
from the rightful owner to use each of these elements, and will hold
harmless, protect, indemnify and defend the non-furnishing party and its
subcontractors from any liability (including attorney’s fees and court
costs), including any claim or suit, threatened or actual, arising from
the use of such elements.

**6. INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY**.

> (the “Client IP”) shall be considered “work for hire” to the maximum
> extent permitted by United States law. If for any reason any element
> of the Client IP is not deemed to be work made for hire, then VBT
> agrees to assign and does hereby assign to Client all right, title,
> and interest in and to such Client IP on a perpetual, exclusive,
> worldwide, sublicensable, and royalty-free basis, and agrees to
