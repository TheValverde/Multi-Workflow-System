EXHIBIT B: Very Big Things, LLC. STATEMENT OF WORK

**INTRODUCTION/BACKGROUND**

The following Statement of Work (SOW) shall serve to outline the current
scope of work required for \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ (“Client”), involving
Very Big Things, LLC (“VBT”) and is made pursuant to the Master Service
Agreement between the parties dated \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ 2025 (the “MSA”).

**SCOPE**

TrackFrame MVP Development: Deliver a production-ready implementation of
TrackFrame as the unified AI orchestration backbone for Client,
including the end-to-end Warehouse Matching workflow, data integrations,
and a polished user interface suitable for client-facing use.

**1. Platform Foundation – TrackFrame**

Core Objectives:

Establish a scalable, secure, and reusable platform that standardizes
authentication, data unification, and workflow management across future
AI modules.

Included Capabilities:

- Authentication & RBAC – Secure login with role-based access for Sales,
  > Ops, and Admin users.

- Connector Framework (MVP) – Native, production-grade connectors for:

- Google Drive – Structured/unstructured data sync (documents, decks,
  > collateral).

- Notion – Structured sync for warehouse data, pricing references, and
  > services.

- Slack\* – If timeline permits, implement a lightweight connection for
  > contextual retrieval from specific channels. Full two-way
  > integration to follow in a later phase.

- UI / UX Framework – Modular interface for hosting AI workflows, with
  > consistent layout and collaboration panel.

\* Slack integration remains a “nice-to-have” enhancement within the MVP
window and shall not be a requirement of this SOW.

**2. Workflow \#1 – Warehouse Matching**

**Core Objectives:**

Digitize and automate lead-to-warehouse matching process using
TrackFrame’s AI reasoning layer and feedback system.

**Included Capabilities:**

- Lead Intake & Enrichment – Capture inbound leads via chat or form;
  > enrich with geography, service, and volume metadata.

- Includes support for screenshot ingestion, with a lightweight
  > image-to-API handling layer enabling contextual GPT interpretation.

- AI Scoping Intelligence – Generate editable summaries and
  > qualification questions.

- Warehouse Data Sync – Automated Notion integration to retrieve
  > warehouse services, trust scores, and capacity data.

- Matching Engine – Rank and recommend optimal warehouses by fit,
  > rationale, and fallback suggestions.

- Action Layer – Enable users to save, share, and draft response emails
  > directly within the conversation thread.

- Feedback Loop – Capture overrides, approvals, and user ratings to
  > inform ongoing optimization.

**Exclusions / Future Phase:**

Autonomous Self-Learning Module – Continuous retraining or
document-driven learning beyond dynamic Notion/Drive sync. During MVP,
the system will automatically incorporate new Notion/Drive data into the
knowledge layer, achieving similar contextual freshness without active
fine-tuning.

**Data & Integrations**

- Notion — Included (core structured data: warehouse, pricing,
  > services).

- Google Drive — Included (core unstructured data: collateral, decks,
  > reference docs).

- Slack — Nice-to-have (optional lightweight connector for contextual
  > retrieval if time allows).

- Screenshot Uploads — Included (inline image uploads with GPT
  > contextual parsing).

- Document Uploads / Self-Learning — Partial (handled via Notion + Drive
  > sync; no active fine-tuning).

**Deliverables**:

- TrackFrame Foundation: Secure, modular backend with authentication,
  > connectors, and unified knowledge layer.

- Warehouse Matching Workflow: End-to-end workflow including intake,
  > enrichment, matching engine, rationale output, and feedback loop.

- Front-End UI: Polished, client-grade interface consistent with demo
  > materials.

- Production Deployment: Hosted instance with live data integration and
  > governed access, plus handover materials.

**INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY**

In addition to the intellectual property rights defined in the MSA, all
right, title and interest to all concepts, designs, improvements,
derivative works, inventions, and/or original works of authorship,

**ESTIMATED COST & TIMELINE**

Fees shall be billed hourly at a rate of \$195/hr. and invoiced in 2
week billing cycles. The estimated cost to complete this R&D and Proof
of Concept phase is \$68,000 - \$78,000 (approximately 350-400 hours),
with an estimated timeline of 10-12 weeks.

**DEPOSIT**

A deposit equal to \$15,000, shall be paid within five (5) business days
of the execution of this SOW. If at any time the Client wishes to
terminate this SOW pursuant to the MSA, the deposit shall be applied
